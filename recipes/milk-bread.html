                Achieve a <em>perfect</em> loaf every time.
            </h2>
            An airy white bread that always tastes as if it is <strong>right out of the oven</strong>!
            It's easy to pull part so you can share it with others. This recipe will be using
            a 9-inch loaf pan, but to achieve a tall loaf an 8-inch loaf pan is recommended.

                    Create the starter.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a small heavy pot, whisk flour, milk, and 1/2 cup (120ml)
                        of water together until smooth.</li>
                        <li>Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and cook, stirring often, until thick but
                            pourable for ~10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>When ready, scrape into a measuring cup and cover the surface with a plastic wrap.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Making the dough.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a mixer bowl with a dough hook, combine: flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.</li>
                        <li>Mix until evenly combined.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add egg, milk, and 1/2 cup of the starter.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix on low speed and knead for 5 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Add soft butter and knead for 10-12 minutes until the dough is smooth, springy, and a bit tacky.</li>
                <li>
                    Punch the dough down.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use your hands to scoop out the dough and place it onto a surface.</li>
                        <li>With a bench scraper / large knife, cut the dough in half.</li>
                        <li>Lightly form each half into a ball, then cover again and let is rise for 15 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Butter up a 9x5in loaf pan while oven is heating up.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gently roll out one dough ball into a thick oval using a rolling pin.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The dough should be moist and no longer sticky.</li>
                        <li>Flour the pin rather than flouring the surface.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Roll away from yourself, then pull in until the oval is ~12 inches long and ~6 inches wide.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fold the top 3 inches down then fold the bottom 3 inches up to make a rough square.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Starting from the right edge of the square, roll up the dough into a log.</li>
                        <li>Pick it up and smooth the top with your hands.</li>
                        <li>Place the log in the buttered pan, seam side down and crosswise, nestling it near one end of the pan.</li>
                        <li>Repeat with the other dough ball, placing it near the other end of the pan.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cover and let it rest for 30-40 minutes.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Let rest until the risen dough is peeking over the edge of the pan and the logs are meeting in the center.</li>
                        <li>Brush the tops of the bread with milk and bake on the bottom shelf of the oven until it is golden brown and puffed.</li>
                        <li>This will be 35-40 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Then, move to a wire rack and let the bread cool for at least 1 hour.</li>
                        <li>This allows the crust to soften up and keeps the crumb loftly.</li> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>If the bread is cut too soon, the air bubbles inside will deflate.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
